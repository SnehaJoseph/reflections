When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1) When i would want other people to contribute to my project
2) When i would want to work on the project from another computer/ location


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork: It is used to make a copy of a reposiroty in GitHuub itself (in another account)
Mainly used when a user does not have permissions to modify the remote repository

Clone: IT is used to copy the data from a repository to a local system.

Branch: While working on code; branches allow the user to create differetn workflows. This allows multiple users to work parallely on the same base code

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I dont know
